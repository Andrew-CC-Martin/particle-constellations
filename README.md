# particle-constellations
Project to create a funky little animation with JavaScript.

Uses [PixiJS library](https://www.pixijs.com/), which is using webgl under the hood. If the browser doesn't have webgl supported, it'll use a regular canvas instead. The only real difference is that you'll lose graphics card support.
